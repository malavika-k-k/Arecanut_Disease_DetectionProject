# ðŸŒ´ Arecanut Disease Prediction using CNN

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to predict diseases in Arecanut (Betel Nut) plants from images.  
The goal is to assist farmers and researchers in identifying plant health issues early for better crop management.

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Arecanut is one of the most important commercial crops, but it is highly susceptible to fungal and bacterial diseases.  
Traditional disease detection is manual and time-consuming.  
This project applies **Deep Learning (CNNs)** to automatically classify arecanut images into categories such as:
- Healthy
- Diseased (e.g., fruit rot, leaf spot, yellow leaf disease, etc.)
